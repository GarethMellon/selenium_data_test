## Selenium Data Test
In this project we want to use selenium to submit data via a form, and verify the data has been saved.

The app was build using Python and Flask Framework.  Tests are running with Selenium web driver.  MongoDb is being used to save the data.

#### Local Settings
To run the app locally, you need to run app.py first and then run the test file against it.
You will require a environment file in order to run locally as this contains keys and the settings for MongoDB.

#### Live Version
The live version is hosted on Heroku and the test file will run against it.
